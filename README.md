# Djikstra-Search-Algorithm-in-Python
This is a class design to implement dijkstra search algorithm in Python using graph adjacency matrix as the underlying data structure. 

**Dijkstra Search Algorithm**

1- The Dijkstra search algorithm is a graph based algorithm that is used to find the shortest distance between start and end node of the grid.
2- The naive implementation of the algorithm (using graph adjacency matrix) can yield time complexity of O(V^2) where V is the number of nodes.
3-The implementation of this graph algorithm using priority queueu leads to enahnced time complexity of O(E+V)logV where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes in the grid.

**Naive Implementation of Dijkstra**

This implementation implements a naive approach of Djikstra algorithm using Graph Adjacency matrix.
